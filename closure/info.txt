My simple words-

When a function is defined in another function and it has access to the outer function's context even after the outer function returns.


Classy definition -

Two one sentence summaries:

    a closure is the local variables for a function â€” kept alive after the function has returned, or
    a closure is a stack-frame which is not deallocated when the function returns (as if a 'stack-frame' were malloc'ed instead of being on the stack!).
